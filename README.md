# Breaking-the-Enigma
A simple code cracking game using elementary Java.
The Computer will generate a Random 4-digit number and you have guess what it
is based on certain hints given by the Computer. If the digit input by the user is
not there in the number, output will show ‘X’ in that position in the number. If the
digit input by the user is there in the number but in the wrong positon, then
output will show ’O’, in that position in the number. If the digit input by the user
is in the correct position, then output will show ‘#’ in that position in the number.

Eg :-
Number generated by Computer = 3497
User Input = 1234
Output = XXOX
User Input = 3079
Output = #XOO
User Input = 3497
Output = ####
“Congratulations! You have cracked the code.”
And that’s all.
